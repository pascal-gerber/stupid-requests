#the print function is here to print out a text, an integer, a float,
#a list, a tuple, a dictionnary, a classobject, a type, a variable value,
#a tkinter object, a module name, ect:
#print is used often at beginning of programming at a "hello world" programm.
#print can also be used to print out all the datatypes possible and deebugging.
#debugging meaning testing of a programm while checking if the value is an expected
#one or not, print is a function itself from its syntax on
#since it has both brackets after, meaning the print function
#is defined somewhere in the main python executable compiler, in fact
#every function is always written this way "isnumeric()" which some
#are predefined, print in particular has a different color in comparason
#to a normal function since it counts as a main function
#print is made in a deep python language and can be found somewhere where all the
#other modules are hidden at.
#print can take multiple arguments since it will print them out all anyways.
#print also contains a auto calculation process meaning printing:
#10 + 4 prints directly 14.
#now imagine your own print function, since adding this command will reduce
#trommendiously the amount of comments i have
#you can imagine it instead riiiiiight here
